### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ebubekir from Istanbul, and I'm a full stack developer. On this GitHub account, I work on several different projects and contribute to the development of open-source software. My main areas of interest are .Net and I develop projects related to these topics. I also use html, css, javascript and react technologies and share knowledge about them. Some of the projects you'll find here include NLayerApp, NetCoreBankApi, ECommerceWithApiAndReact and I plan to release others soon. I'm always on a journey of learning and growth in the open-source software development process and strive to embrace this philosophy in the projects I share here.
